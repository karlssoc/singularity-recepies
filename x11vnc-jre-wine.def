# docker source is https://github.com/x11vnc/x11vnc-desktop/ (ubuntu + ldex desktop + x11vnc)
# with added java runtime enviroment & wine
# running the sif "singularity run x11vnc-jre-wine.sif" starts x11vnc on port 5900 to 59XX
# new vnc password is generated with each launch
# to remotely connect with a VNC client you might need to tunnel VNC through SSH:
